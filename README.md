Face Recognition System
This project implements a face recognition system using OpenCV and LBPH (Local Binary Patterns Histograms). The system is capable of detecting faces, generating datasets, training a classifier, and recognizing faces in real-time.

This project is designed to create a real-time face recognition system using Python and OpenCV. It involves three main steps:

 1.Generating a dataset of faces.
 2.Training a face recognizer using the dataset.
 3.Recognizing faces in real-time using the trained recognizer.

 Requirements
  Python 3.x
  OpenCV
  NumPy
  PIL (Python Imaging Library)

Generating Dataset
Run the generate_dataset.py script to capture and save images.

Training the Classifier
Run the train_classifier.py script to train the face recognizer

Recognizing Faces
Run the recognize_faces.py script to start real-time face recognition


The system can detect and recognize faces in real-time. It labels recognized faces with the corresponding names "Soham" and "Maithili" based on the trained dataset.
